# A Clean Modern UI
A clean and modern UI for Foundry VTT. Inspired by MacOS/IOS using flat interface and glasslike surfaces. Rounded off all the corners and shifted the interface around a little. 

This is my first delve into modifying Foundry so many of the solutions for this UI may seem hack-y. The blur effects will cause some performance hit, so it may not be suitable for laptop use. Once I get more familair with coding, I'm looking to add a settings menu to change accent colors & maybe a dark mode.
