# ACleanModernUI
A clean and modern UI for Foundry VTT. Inspired by MacOS/IOS using flat interface and glasslike surfaces. Rounded off all the corners and shifted the interface around a little. Have support for Calendar/Weather widget in a fixed location along the bottom of the screen as I didnt like how it was somehow always in the way. 

This is my first delve into modifying Foundry so many of the solutions for this UI may seem hack-y. The blur effects will cause some performance hit, so it may not be suitable for laptop use.
